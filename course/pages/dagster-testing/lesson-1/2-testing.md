Dagster believes that data engineering should feel like software engineering. And anyone who has been involved in software engineering knows the importance of testing.

Testing is crucial in software engineering. With proper testing in place, potential issues can be discovered much earlier in the development process which helps to minimize risk. This helps developers feel more confident about iterating on a system while making changes.

## Types of testing

Within testing there are many specific forms that tests can take. Each requirement is unique and is tailored to covering different parts of your overall application.

1. Unit Testing
Tests individual components or functions in isolation.

2. Integration Testing
Ensures that different modules or services work together as expected.

3. Regression Testing
Confirms that recent code changes havenâ€™t broken existing functionality.

4. Performance Testing
Evaluates software speed, scalability, and stability under load.

5. Security Testing
Identifies vulnerabilities and ensures data protection.

There are many other subdisciplines of testing you could break out. Testing means different things to different roles and a single person is usually not responsible for the entire testing stack.

This course will primarily focus on the testing more closely tied with the building applications (unit, integration and system).
