# Overview

So far everything we have learned applies to general best practices in Python testing. We have learned how to apply unit testing, mocks and integration testing in the context of Dagster but these apply universally to almost any code you could write.

In this final lesson we will discuss some Dagster specific elements of testing. This will cover Dagster features to help you run your platform in production and some tips on tests you should add to your project to make sure you can always build with confidence.
