# Overview

So far everything we have learned are general testing best practices in Python. We have learned how to apply unit testing, mocks and integration testing in the context of Dagster but these apply universally to almost any code you could write.

In this final lesson we will discuss some Dagster specific elements of testing. This will cover Dagster features designed to help you run your data platform in production and some best practices for tests you should add to ensure you project is maintainable.
