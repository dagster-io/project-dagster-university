# Overview

In the previous lesson, you learned that there are many different types of testing. This lesson will focus on unit tests and creating the fundamental tests for your Dagster assets. We will discuss the various aspects of writing tests for your assets before we cover other Dagster concepts in future lessons. If you are familiar with tests in Python, you will find that writing tests in Dagster is very similar. If this is your first time writing tests in Python, most of this lesson will carry over to your general Python knowledge.
