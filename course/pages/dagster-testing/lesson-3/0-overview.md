# Overview

In the previous lesson, you learned that there are many different types of testing. This lesson will focus on unit tests and creating the fundamental tests for your Dagster assets. We will discuss the various aspects of writing tests for your assets before we cover other Dagster concepts in future lessons.

Tests in Dagster leverage conventional Python tooling and methodology. Learning about tests in Python generally is relevant to implementing tests in Dagster. The Dagster-specific learning curve is limited to efficiently using Dagsterâ€™s built-in tests features and a practical working knowledge of which tests to use when with reference examples. If this is your first time writing tests in Python, most of this lesson will carry over to your general Python knowledge.
