# Overview

As your data platform scales, it will cover an increasing number of systems. With more systems to account for you will start to reach the limits of what you can accomplish with basic unit tests. In this lesson we will discuss how to leverage mocks to replace parts of the system we rely on during testing. This will give us the ability to still have test coverage and ensure the functionality of our Dagster assets while maintaining the feedback loop of unit tests.
