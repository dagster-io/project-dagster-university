# Sling with Components

To navigate including Components with Dagster, we will be using the Dagster `dg` command line. `dg` is a useful to initializing and navigating Dagster projects. Because we have been working the virtual envionment and project structure of this course we have not needed `dg` as much.

We used `dg` before to lanuch the UI to view and execute our assets but now we will use it to scaffold our Component.

## Create dlt Component

To initialize our dlt Component, we will run the `dg` command to scaffold the Sling Component (`dagster_sling.SlingReplicationCollectionComponent`): 

```bash
dg scaffold defs 'dagster_sling.SlingReplicationCollectionComponent' ingest_files
```

There will now be a new directory in `defs` containing two files:

```
.
├── component.yaml
└── replication.yaml
```

These are the only two files we will need to interact with in order to configure our Sling assets (no Python). Let's discuss what goes into each.

## Configure the YAML

The `replication.yaml` should look familiar. That is the yaml file that Sling uses to determine the replication characteristics. The `replication.yaml` that is generated by the `dg` command is pretty much empty:

```yaml
source: {}
streams: {}
target: {}
```

Let's copy and paste all of the contents from our `sling_replication.yaml` from the previous lesson:

```yaml
source: MY_POSTGRES
target: MY_DUCKDB

defaults:
  mode: full-refresh

  object: "{stream_schema}_{stream_table}"

streams:
  data.customers:
  data.products:
  data.orders:
    mode: incremental
    primary_key: order_id
    update_key: order_date
```

The next file is the `component.yaml`. This contains two bits of information. Which component we are using, in this case Sling, and the location of the `replication.yaml`.

```
type: dagster_sling.SlingReplicationCollectionComponent

attributes:
  replications:
    - path: replication.yaml
```

The only thing we need to add are the connection details. Before we had defined these within the `SlingResource` but there is no need for that with Components. Instead we will enter the connection details in the `component.yaml`:

```yaml
type: dagster_sling.SlingReplicationCollectionComponent

attributes:
  sling:
    connections:
      - name: MY_POSTGRES
        type: postgres
        host: localhost
        port: 5432
        database: test_db
        user: test_user
        password: test_pass
      - name: MY_DUCKDB
        type: duckdb
        instance: duckdb:///var/tmp/duckdb.db
  replications:
    - path: replication.yaml
```

Notice that the names of the connection in the `components.yaml` still need to match up to the `replication.yaml` (`MY_DUCKDB` and `MY_POSTGRES`).

## Viewing the assets

Because we switching our assets over to components, we can cleanup a lot of our Python code. In `resources.py` you can remove everything related Sling. And in the `assets.py` file you can remove the assets generated by the `sling_assets`. We can still keep the assets downstream of the Component assets.

Now if we run `dg dev` we can see the same asset graph as before.
