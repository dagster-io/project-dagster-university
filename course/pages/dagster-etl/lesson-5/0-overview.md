The pipelines we have built so far are great for learning the foundations of ETL pipeline construction and how to apply Dagster features. Though these are not necessarily pipelines we would want to push into production. The problem with these pipelines is that we are unnecessarily developing too much from scratch. One nice thing about ETL is that it is a universal problem that many organizations have to deal with. Because of that, there are a wide range of tools and frameworks that exist to make ETL easier.
