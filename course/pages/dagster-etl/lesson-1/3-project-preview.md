# Project preview

In this course, weâ€™ll focus on ETL and how to manage data ingestion using Dagster. All of the examples will walk through real-world ETL workflows you're likely to encounter, covering a variety of data sources and the unique challenges they present.

By the end of the course, you will:

- Create scheduled and event-driven pipelines to ingest files
- Build a custom resource to pull data from an external API
- Use Embedded ETL (with dlt) to build more resilient applications
- Replicate data across databases
- Refactor your code using Dagster Components for better modularity and reuse

If you get stuck or want to jump ahead, check out the [finished project here on GitHub](https://github.com/dagster-io/project-dagster-university/tree/main/dagster_university/dagster_and_etl/dagster_and_etl/completed).
