# Sling

In the previous lesson we used dlt. dlt is great for flexibility but since we know we are doing replication between two systems, we can try something else (though dlt can also do replication).

For this lesson weâ€™ll introduce another open-source ETL framework: [Sling](https://docs.slingdata.io/). Sling is a modern tool designed to simplify both real-time and batch data replication. It helps teams move data from databases like Postgres and MySQL into cloud data warehouses such as Snowflake or Redshift with minimal setup. Exposing all configuration through a simple YAML interface. 

Sling differs from dlt in that it is declarative by design. While dlt offers greater flexibility and can handle data ingestion from a wide variety of sources (such as our custom NASA API), Sling is purpose-built for database replication and excels at managing the complexities of moving data and schema evolution.
