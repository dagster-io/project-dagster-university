# Dagster Components

Dagster Components provide a class-based interface (Component) for dynamically constructing Dagster definitions from arbitrary data such as third-party integrations. They’re designed to simplify orchestration by encapsulating complex logic into reusable, declarative building blocks.

To put this in the context of what we’ve been building: a Component can be used to manage our dlt connection between Postgres and DuckDB. This allows you to skip the low-level setup like CLI initialization with a separate library and focus only on the inputs and outputs that matter for your use case.

This approach is especially powerful for common workflows like database replication, which shouldn’t require extensive development. Instead, a user should be able to provide a few configuration values — like connection details or table filters — and let the Component handle the rest. This lowers the barrier for non-engineers or new users, allowing them to integrate systems in Dagster without needing deep knowledge of the framework’s internals.

Let’s now walk through how to configure Postgres-to-DuckDB replication using a Dagster Component. This will demonstrate how much easier and cleaner your setup can become when you lean on Components to handle orchestration and integration under the hood.
