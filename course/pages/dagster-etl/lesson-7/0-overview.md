# Overview

We’ve now covered a wide range of ETL use cases, from static files and APIs to database replication. Interestingly, as our pipelines have grown more complex, our code has actually become simpler. That’s thanks to the thoughtful abstractions provided by tools like dlt and Dagster.

The last topic we’ll cover is Dagster Components. So far, we’ve seen how Dagster and dlt can work together to build robust pipelines. However, coordinating the two, especially if you’re new to dlt, can sometimes feel a bit tricky. You have to initialize configurations with the dlt CLI, manage secret files, and be mindful of how everything connects.

Now that you’ve seen the pieces involved in building these pipelines manually, you’ll have a deeper appreciation for just how much Dagster Components simplify ETL development.
