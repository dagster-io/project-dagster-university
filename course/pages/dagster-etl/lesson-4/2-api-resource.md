# API Resource

When working with external APIs in Dagster, it's often best to start by creating a resource. A resource provides a clean abstraction for external services, making it easy to reuse API logic across multiple assets. It also simplifies testing and long-term maintenance by isolating API-specific logic in a single, well-defined interface.

Before we write any code, let’s review the characteristics of the NeoWs (Near Earth Object Web Service) API. The base URL for the endpoint is:

```bash
https://api.nasa.gov/neo/rest/v1/feed
```

This endpoint supports three query parameters:

| Parameter	| Type | Default | Description|
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| start_date | YYYY-MM-DD | none | Starting date for asteroid search |
| end_date | YYYY-MM-DD | 7 days after start_date | Ending date for asteroid search |
| api_key | string | DEMO_KEY | api.nasa.gov key for expanded usage |

Given this structure, a full API request might look like:

```bash
https://api.nasa.gov/neo/rest/v1/feed?start_date=2015-09-07&end_date=2015-09-08&api_key=DEMO_KEY
```

The API will return a large JSON response that includes various metadata fields. To keep things simple, we’ll focus only on the part we care about — the `near_earth_objects` field. This field contains the actual asteroid data, organized by date, and is all we need for our ETL pipeline.

## Coding our resource

Now that we know the API endpoint and the parameters required to make a call, let’s write our resource. There are many ways to structure this, but we’ll keep the implementation lean.

We’ll create a resource called `NASAResource`, which is initialized from our API key. This resource will expose a single method: `get_near_earth_asteroids` with two parameters (start_date, end_date), which returns the parsed JSON response from the API.

Here’s what that might look like:

```python {% obfuscated="true" %}
import dagster as dg
import requests


class NASAResource(dg.ConfigurableResource):
    api_key: str

    def get_near_earth_asteroids(self, start_date: str, end_date: str):
        url = "https://api.nasa.gov/neo/rest/v1/feed"
        params = {
            "start_date": start_date,
            "end_date": end_date,
            "api_key": self.api_key,
        }

        resp = requests.get(url, params=params)
        return resp.json()["near_earth_objects"][start_date]
```

Now that we have our resource defined, we can include it in the `Definitions` alongside the `DuckDBResource` resource:

```python
defs = dg.Definitions(
    resources={
        "nasa": NASAResource(
            api_key=dg.EnvVar("NASA_API_KEY"),
        ),
        "database": DuckDBResource(
            database="data/staging/data.duckdb",
        ),
    },
)
```

**Note**: Remember you will need to set the environment variable `NASA_API_KEY` to the API key you created if you want to execute this pipeline.
