# Partitions

When running ETL pipelines in production, it's important to have a reliable way to track what data has been loaded, especially when a pipeline has matured and contains a longer execution history.

Without a structured approach, it can become difficult to manage which data has been processed. How do we know which files have yet to be processed? Dagster addresses this challenge with partitions. Partitions allow you to break down your data into smaller, logical segments: such as date, region, or category. Each segment can then be treated and tacked as an independent unit tied to a specific execution.

Partitions can then be tied to assets. Configured an asset with partitions allows you to:

- Materialize and update only specific partitions, avoiding unnecessary reprocessing of unchanged data.
- Launch targeted backfills to reprocess historical data or recover from failures without rerunning the entire pipeline.
- Track the status and lineage of each partition independently, giving you better visibility and control over your data workflows.

## Creating partitions

Let's go back to our `import_file` asset. What is a logical way to divide that data if our three files look like this?

- 2018-01-22.csv
- 2018-01-23.csv
- 2018-01-24.csv

Based on these files, it would be safe to assume that each corresponds to a specific day. This lends itself to a daily partition which we can configure with Dagster like so:

```python
partitions_def = dg.DailyPartitionsDefinition(
    start_date="2018-01-21",
    end_date="2018-01-24",
)
```

This creates a partition specifically for the dates 2018-01-22 to 20218-01-24. If we removed the upper bound (`end_date`) this partition would include all days from 2018-01-22 to present. This can be useful for new incoming files but for this example we will limit our partition to only include the days contained in our local files.

## Partitioned assets

Now that weâ€™ve defined our partition, we can use the partition in a new asset called `import_partition_file`. This asset will rely on the partition key instead of the `FilePath` run configuration to determine which file should be processed.

The core logic of the asset remains the same but now you can run the pipeline for each day between 2018-01-21 and 2018-01-23, with each partition corresponding to a file for that date. This allows you to scale execution, track progress per partition, and reprocess specific days as needed:

```python
@dg.asset(
    partitions_def=partitions_def,
    group_name="static_etl",
)
def import_partition_file(context: dg.AssetExecutionContext) -> str:
    file_path = (
        Path(__file__).absolute().parent
        / f"../../../../data/source/{context.partition_key}.csv"
    )
    return str(file_path.resolve())
```

Finally we can create a new downstream asset that relies on the partitioned data:

```python
@dg.asset(
    kinds={"duckdb"},
    partitions_def=partitions_def,
    group_name="static_etl",
)
def duckdb_partition_table(
    context: dg.AssetExecutionContext,
    database: DuckDBResource,
    import_partition_file,
):
    table_name = "raw_partition_data"
    with database.get_connection() as conn:
        table_query = f"""
            create table if not exists {table_name} (
                date date,
                share_price float,
                amount float,
                spend float,
                shift float,
                spread float
            ) 
        """
        conn.execute(table_query)
        conn.execute(f"delete from {table_name} where date = '{context.partition_key}';")
        conn.execute(f"copy {table_name} from '{import_partition_file}';")
```

This is very similar to our original logic except for are two key differences:

1. We now include the partition (`partitions_def`) in the `@dg.asset decorator`.
2. We add a `DELETE FROM...` SQL statement targeting the table for the specific partition date. This ensures the pipeline is idempotent, allowing us to run backfills without the risk of data duplication.

A quick not that deleting from the table before loading new data is one strategy for achieving idempotence. Another approach is to import the incoming data into a staging location and then upsert the new data into the final table. This method has the advantage of preserving existing data in the final table in case an error occurs during the copy process. And while the staging strategy is generally more resilient, we will use the simpler `DELETE FROM...` method for the purposes of this course.
