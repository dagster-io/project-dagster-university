# Practice: Create a taxi_zones asset

Letâ€™s use what you learned about creating dependencies between assets to practice creating an asset with dependencies.

In Lesson 3, you created a `taxi_zones_file` asset that downloads a CSV containing data about NYC taxi zones.

Now, create a `taxi_zones` asset that uses the `taxi_zones_file` file to create a table called `zones` in your DuckDB database. This new table should have four columns:

- `zone_id`, which is the `LocationID` column, renamed
- `zone`
- `borough`
- `geometry`, which is the `the_geom` column, renamed

## Check your work

The asset you built should look similar to the following code. Click **View answer** to view it.

**If there are differences**, compare what you wrote to the asset below and change them, as this asset will be used as-is in future lessons.

```python {% obfuscated="true" %}
@asset(
    deps=["taxi_zones_file"]
)
def taxi_zones() -> None:
    query = f"""
        create or replace table zones as (
            select
                LocationID as zone_id,
                zone,
                borough,
                the_geom as geometry
            from '{constants.TAXI_ZONES_FILE_PATH}'
        );
    """

    conn = backoff(
        fn=duckdb.connect,
        retry_on=(RuntimeError, duckdb.IOException),
        kwargs={
            "database": os.getenv("DUCKDB_DATABASE"),
        },
        max_retries=10,
    )
    conn.execute(query)
```
