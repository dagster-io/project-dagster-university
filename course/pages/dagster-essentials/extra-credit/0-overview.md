# Overview

Welcome to extra credit, ambitious student!

By this point, you have two working data pipelines: one you built progressively throughout this course’s lessons, and the other during the course capstone. Building a data pipeline from end-to-end is a useful skill, but there’s still another skill you can learn to level up. Using **metadata**, or data that provides information about other data, you can document your pipeline and make it easy for others to understand.

In this lesson, we’ll cover:

- What’s metadata and the benefits of using it
- Definition metadata
- Materialization metadata
- How to locate metadata in the UI
