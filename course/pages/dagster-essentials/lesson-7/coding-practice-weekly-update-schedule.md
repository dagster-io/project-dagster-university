# Practice: Create a weekly_update_schedule

To practice what youâ€™ve learned, add a schedule to `schedules/__init__.py` that:

- Is named `weekly_update_schedule`
- Materializes the `trips_by_week` asset
- Runs every Monday at midnight

## Check your work

The schedule you built should look similar to the following code. Click **View answer** to view it.

**If there are differences**, compare what you wrote to the schedule below and change them, as this schedule will be used as-is in future lessons.

```python {% obfuscated="true" %}
from dagster import AssetSelection, ScheduleDefinition

from ..jobs import weekly_update_job

weekly_update_schedule = ScheduleDefinition(
    job=weekly_update_job,
    cron_schedule="0 0 * * 1", # every Monday at midnight
)
```
