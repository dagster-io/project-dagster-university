# Enabling the sensor

As sensors are turned off by default, you'll need to enable the sensor to be able to use it. In this section, we'll walk you through turning the sensor on in the Dagster UI.

  In `data/requests`, youâ€™ll find a `README` that contains instructions for triggering the sensor. Use the example `.json` in the `README` to create a new file named `january-staten-island.json` that contains the code on the right.

  ```json
  {
    "start_date": "2023-01-10",
    "end_date": "2023-01-25",
    "borough": "Staten Island"
  }
  ```

  Dagster provides the ability to test sensors directly from the UI, which can be helpful with simulating sensors that are triggered either too frequently or not frequently enough.

  1. If you navigated away from the **Sensor details** page for the `adhoc_request_sensor`, navigate back to it before continuing.

  2. On this page, click the **Test Sensor** button near the top-right of the page. This allows you to produce a single tick without turning the sensor on.

  3. Click **Evaluate** to begin the test.

  When the test completes, the results will display. Click the **Open in Launchpad** button to navigate to the `adhoc_request_job`.

  Notice how the launchpad has been pre-populated with the config from the `january-staten-island.json` file.

  Click **Launch Run** at the bottom of the page to submit the run.

  After the run completes, navigate to `data/outputs` in the project directory, where the asset saved the output file. You should see a bar chart like the one on the right.
