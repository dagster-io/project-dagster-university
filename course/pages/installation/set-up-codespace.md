# Set up with Github Codespace

Instead of you setting up a local environment, you can use [Github Codespaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces). This will allow you to work through this course and edit code in this repository in a cloud based environment.

## Creating a Github Codespace

There are unique Codespaces for the different courses in Dagster University. Be sure to select the create one creating a Codespace.

1. While logged into Github, go to the [Codespaces page](https://github.com/codespaces).
2. In the top right, select "New Codespace"
3. Create a Codespace using the following.

    | Field | Value |
    |--- | --- |
    | Repository | dagster-io/project-dagster-university |
    | Branch | main |
    | Dev container configuration | Specific course name |
    | Region | US East |
    | Machine type | 2-core |

4. Click "Create codespace"

The first time you create a codespace it may take a minute for everything to start. You will then be dropped in an interactive editor containing the code for the entire Dagster University repository.

## Working in the Codespace

In the terminal at the bottom of the Codespace IDE, navigate to the specific course directory. For example, if you are completing "Dagster Essentials", change into that directory:

```bash
cd dagster_university/dagster_essentials
```

To ensure everything is working you can launch the Dagster UI.

```bash
dagster dev
```

After Dagster starts running you will be prompted to open the Dagster UI within your browser. Click "Open in Browser".

## Create .env file

You will want to make a copy of the example file `.env.example` which will be used later on.

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

## Stopping your Github Codespace

Be sure to stop your Codespace when you are not using it. Github provides personal accounts [120 cores hours per month](https://docs.github.com/en/billing/managing-billing-for-your-products/managing-billing-for-github-codespaces/about-billing-for-github-codespaces#monthly-included-storage-and-core-hours-for-personal-accounts).
