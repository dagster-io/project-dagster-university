# Setting up Dagster+

Now that the project is set up and ready in GitHub, itâ€™s time to move to Dagster+. To keep things simple, weâ€™ll use a [Serverless deployment](https://docs.dagster.io/dagster-plus/deployment/serverless) to deploy our project. This option offloads managing the required infrastructure to Dagster Labs.

1. Sign up for a new [Dagster+ trial account](https://dagster.cloud/signup). Even if you already have an account, create a new one for this course. **Note:**  When you sign up for a new account, youâ€™ll automatically begin a free trial. You wonâ€™t be charged for anything after the trial unless you enter a credit card.
2. Complete the signup flow by creating an organization and finishing your user profile.
3. When prompted to select a deployment type, click **Serverless.**
4. The next step is to add our project to Dagster+! Click the **Import a Dagster project** option and do the following:
    1. In the **Git scope** field, select the GitHub account or organization that contains your project repository.
       
       {% callout %}
       > ðŸ’¡ **Donâ€™t see the right account/organization?** You may need to install the Dagster+ GitHub app first. To do this, click **+ Add account or organization.** Youâ€™ll be redirected to GitHub to complete the setup, and then automatically sent back to Dagster+ when finished. If youâ€™re installing within your companyâ€™s GitHub organization, you may need your companyâ€™s GitHub admin to approve the app.
       {% /callout %}
        
    2. In the **Repository** field, select the repository containing your Dagster project.
    3. Click **Deploy. Note that the deployment can take a few minutes.** Feel free to go grab a snack while youâ€™re waiting!

## What happens when Dagster+ deploys code?

When Dagster deploys the code, a few things happen:

- Dagster creates a new code location for the repository in Dagster+ in the `prod` deployment
- Dagster adds two GitHub Action files to the repository:
    - `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` - This file sets up Continuous Deployment (CD) for the repository. We wonâ€™t talk through all the steps here, but a high-level summary is that every time a change is made to the `main` branch of your repository, this GitHub Action will build your Dagster project and deploy it to Dagster+.
    - `.github/workflows/branch_deployments.yml` - This file enables the use of [Branch Deployments](https://docs.dagster.io/dagster-cloud/managing-deployments/branch-deployments), a Dagster+ feature that automatically creates staging environments for your Dagster code with every pull request. We wonâ€™t work with Branch Deployments during this lesson, but we highly recommend trying them out!

## Checking deployment status

It looks like the deployment was completed, but it failed. If we look in the GitHub Action logs for the job, weâ€™ll see the following error in the **Python Executable Deploy** step:

```yaml
Error: Some locations failed to load after being synced by the agent:
Error loading dagster_university: {'__typename': 'PythonError', 'message': "FileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: '/venvs/3eca07cc1eb5/lib/python3.8/site-packages/working_directory/root/analytics/target/manifest.json'\n" ...
```

Your deployment failed because Dagster could not find a dbt manifest file. In the next section of this lesson, weâ€™ll walk you through fixing this.
