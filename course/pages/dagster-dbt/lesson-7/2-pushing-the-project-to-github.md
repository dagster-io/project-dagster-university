# Pushing the project to GitHub

Weâ€™ll be using GitHub in this lesson because Dagster+ has a native integration with GitHub to quickly get deployment set up. This functionality can be easily replicated if your company uses a different version control provider, but weâ€™ll standardize on using GitHub for now. Whether you use the command line or an app like GitHub Desktop is up to you.

Because you cloned this project, itâ€™ll already have a git history and context. Letâ€™s use a new repository on GitHub, instead.

1. Create the repository in GitHub, then clone it to your workstation.
2. Copy the contents of `project-dagster-university/dagster_university/dagster_and_dbt/` from the Dagster University cloned repo into the root of your new repository. For example, `cp -R ~/project-dagster-university/dagster_university/dagster_and_dbt/* ~/my-dagster-and-dbt-repo/`.
3. To avoid committing environment variables or a large DuckDB file, copy the .gitignore from the Dagster University repo into your new repo. For example, `cp ~/project-dagster-university/.gitignore ~/my-dagster-and-dbt-repo/`
4. Push the code from your project into this GitHub repositoryâ€™s `main` branch.

> ðŸ’¡ **Important!** Make sure the `.env` file in your project isnâ€™t included in your commit! The starter project for this course should have it listed in `.gitignore`, but itâ€™s wise to double-check before accidentally committing sensitive files.
