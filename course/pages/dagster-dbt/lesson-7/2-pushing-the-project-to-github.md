# Pushing the project to GitHub

Weâ€™ll be using GitHub in this lesson because Dagster+ has a native integration with GitHub to quickly get deployment set up. This functionality can be easily replicated if your company uses a different version control provider, but weâ€™ll standardize on using GitHub for now. Whether you use the command line or an app like GitHub Desktop is up to you.

1. Because you cloned this project, itâ€™ll already have a git history and context. Letâ€™s delete that by running `rm -rf .git`.
2. Create a new repository on GitHub.
3. Push the code from your project into this GitHub repositoryâ€™s `main` branch.

> ðŸ’¡ **Important!** Make sure the `.env` file in your project isnâ€™t included in your commit! The starter project for this course should have it listed in `.gitignore`, but itâ€™s wise to double-check before accidentally committing sensitive files.
