# Overview

As you learned in Lesson 1, Dagster and dbt have similar mental models because both frameworks excel at building data models, defining relationships between them, and materializing them. You should have also grasped that dbt models are conceptually data assets and that these data assets can be represented in Dagster.

In this lesson, youâ€™ll learn how to turn that conceptual understanding into real life by connecting a dbt project to Dagster, manually running your dbt models, and understanding what happens when Dagster runs dbt.
