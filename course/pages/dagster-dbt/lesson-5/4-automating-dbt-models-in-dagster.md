# Automating dbt models in Dagster

Did you realize that your dbt models have already been scheduled to run on a regular basis because of an existing schedule within this Dagster project?

Check it out in the Dagster UI by clicking **Overview** in the top navigation bar, then the **Jobs** tab. Click `trip_update_job` to check out the jobâ€™s details. It looks like the dbt models are already attached to this job!

Pretty cool, right? Letâ€™s check out the code that made this happen. Open the `dagster_university/jobs/__init__.py` and look at the definition for `trip_update_job`:

```python
trip_update_job = define_asset_job(
    name="trip_update_job",
    partitions_def=monthly_partition,
    selection=AssetSelection.all() - trips_by_week - adhoc_request
)
```

The dbt models were included in this job because of the `AssetSelection.all()` call. This reinforces the idea that once you load your dbt project into your Dagster project, Dagster will recognize and treat all of your dbt models as assets.

## Excluding specific dbt models

Treating dbt models as assets is great, but one of the core tenets of Dagsterâ€™s dbt integration is respecting how dbt is used, along with meeting dbt users where they are. Thatâ€™s why there are a few utility methods that should feel familiar to dbt users. Letâ€™s use one of these methods to remove some of our dbt models from this job explicitly.

Pretend that youâ€™re working with an analytics engineer, iterating on the `stg_trips` model and planning to add new models that depend on it soon. Therefore, youâ€™d like to exclude `stg_trips` and any new hypothetical dbt models downstream of it until the pipeline stabilizes. The analytics engineer youâ€™re working with is really strong with dbt, but not too familiar with Dagster.

This is where youâ€™d lean on a function like [`build_dbt_asset_selection`](https://docs.dagster.io/_apidocs/libraries/dagster-dbt#dagster_dbt.build_dbt_asset_selection). This utility method will help your analytics engineer contribute without needing to know Dagsterâ€™s asset selection syntax. It takes two arguments:

- A list of `@dbt_assets` definitions to select models from
- A string of the selector using [dbtâ€™s selection syntax](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/node-selection/syntax) of the models you want to select

The function will return an `AssetSelection` of the dbt models that match your dbt selector. Letâ€™s put this into practice:

1. At the top of `jobs/__init__.py`, import `dbt_analytics` from the `assets.dbt` module, along with the `build_dbt_asset_selection` function from `dagster_dbt`:
    
    ```python
    from ..assets.dbt import dbt_analytics
    from dagster_dbt import build_dbt_asset_selection
    ```
    
2. After the other selections, define a new variable called `dbt_trips_selection` and make a call to `build_dbt_asset_selection`. Pass in the `dbt_analytics` definition and a string that selects `stg_trips` and all dbt models downstream of it:
    
    ```python
    dbt_trips_selection = build_dbt_asset_selection([dbt_analytics], "stg_trips+")
    ```
    
3. Next, update the `selection` argument in the `trip_update_job` to subtract the `dbt_trips_selection`: 
    
    ```python
    trip_update_job = define_asset_job(
        name="trip_update_job",
        partitions_def=monthly_partition,
        selection=AssetSelection.all() - trips_by_week - adhoc_request - dbt_trips_selection
    )
    ```
    
4. Reload the code location and confirm that the dbt models are not in the `trip_update_job` anymore!

   ![trip_update_job without dbt models](/images/dagster-dbt/lesson-5/job-with-dbt-models.png)

You might notice that the `airport_trips` asset is still scheduled to run with this job! Thatâ€™s because the `build_dbt_asset_selection` function only selects *dbt models* and **not** Dagster assets.

If you want to also exclude the new `airport_trips` asset from this job, modify the `dbt_trips_selection` to include all *downstream assets*, too. Because weâ€™re using Dagsterâ€™s native functionality to select all downstream assets, we can now drop the `+` from the dbt selector:

```python
dbt_trips_selection = build_dbt_asset_selection([dbt_analytics], "stg_trips").downstream()
```

Reload the code location and look at the `trip_update_job` once more to verify that everything looks right:
