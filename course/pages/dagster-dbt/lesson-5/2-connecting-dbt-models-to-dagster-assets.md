# Connecting dbt models to Dagster assets

With where we left off, you may have noticed that the sources for your dbt projects are not just tables that exist in DuckDB, but also *assets* that Dagster created. However, the staging models (`stg_trips`, `stg_zones`) that use those sources arenâ€™t linked to the Dagster assets (`taxi_trips`, `taxi_zones`) that produced them:

![dbt models unconnected to Dagster assets](/images/dagster-dbt/lesson-5/unconnected-sources-assets.png)

Letâ€™s fix that by telling Dagster that the dbt sources are the tables that the `taxi_trips` and `taxi_zones` asset definitions produce. To match up these assets, we'll override the dbt assets' keys. By having the asset keys line up, Dagster will know that these assets are the same and should merge them.

This is accomplished by changing the dbt sourceâ€™s asset keys to be the same as the matching assets that Dagster makes. In this case, the dbt sourceâ€™s default asset key is `raw_taxis/trips`, and the table that weâ€™re making with Dagster has an asset key of `taxi_trips`.

To adjust how Dagster names the asset keys for your projectâ€™s dbt models, weâ€™ll need to override the `dagster-dbt` integrationâ€™s default logic for how to interpret the dbt project. This mapping is contained in the `DagsterDbtTranslator` class.

## Customizing how Dagster understands dbt projects

The `DagsterDbtTranslator` class is the default mapping for how Dagster interprets and maps your dbt project. As Dagster loops through each of your dbt models, it will execute each of the translatorâ€™s functions and use the return value to configure your new Dagster asset.

However, you can override its methods by making a new class that inherits from and provides your logic for a dbt model. Refer to the `dagster-dbt` packageâ€™s [API Reference](https://docs.dagster.io/_apidocs/libraries/dagster-dbt#dagster_dbt.DagsterDbtTranslator) for more info on the different functions you can override in the `DagsterDbtTranslator` class.

For now, weâ€™ll customize how asset keys are defined by overriding the translatorâ€™s `get_asset_key` method.

Open the `assets/dbt.py` file and do the following:

1. Update the imports to include:
   - From the `dagster_dbt` module, import `DagsterDbtTranslator`
   - From the `dagster` module, import `AssetKey`

2. Create a new class called `CustomizedDagsterDbtTranslator` that inherits from the `DagsterDbtTranslator`. Add this code after the imports in `assets/dbt.py`:
    
   ```python
   class CustomizedDagsterDbtTranslator(DagsterDbtTranslator):
   ```
    
3. In this class, create a method called `get_asset_key.`

   This is a method of `DagsterDbtTranslator` class that we'll override and customize to do as we need. It is an instance method, so we'll have its first argument be `self`, to follow [Pythonic conventions](https://builtin.com/software-engineering-perspectives/python-guide). The second argument refers to a dictionary/JSON object for the dbt modelâ€™s properties, which is based on the manifest file from earlier. Letâ€™s call that second argument `dbt_resource_props`. The return value of this function is an object of the `AssetKey` class.
    
    ```python
    class CustomizedDagsterDbtTranslator(DagsterDbtTranslator):
        def get_asset_key(self, dbt_resource_props):
    ```
    
4. Now, letâ€™s fill in the `get_asset_key` method with our own logic for defining asset keys.
    
   1. There are two properties that weâ€™ll want from `dbt_resource_props`: the `resource_type` (ex., model, source, seed, snapshot) and the `name`, such as `trips` or `stg_trips`. Access both of those properties from the `dbt_resource_props` argument and store them in their own respective variables (`type` and `name`):
       
      ```python
      def get_asset_key(self, dbt_resource_props):
          resource_type = dbt_resource_props["resource_type"]
          name = dbt_resource_props["name"]
      ```
        
   2. As mentioned above, the asset keys of our existing Dagster assets used by our dbt project are named `taxi_trips` and `taxi_zones`. If you were to print out the `name`, youâ€™d see that the dbt sources are named `trips` and `zones`. Therefore, to match our asset keys up, we can prefix our keys with the string `taxi_` . 
   
      Copy and paste the following code to return an `AssetKey` of `AssetKey(f"taxi_{name}")`:
       
      ```python
      def get_asset_key(self, dbt_resource_props):
          resource_type = dbt_resource_props["resource_type"]
          name = dbt_resource_props["name"]
      
          return AssetKey(f"taxi_{name}")
      ```
        
   3. You have full control over how each asset can be named, as you can define how asset keys are created. In our case we only want to rename the dbt sources, but we can keep the asset keys of the models the same. 
   
      The object-oriented pattern of the `DagsterDbtTranslator` means that we can leverage the existing implementations of the parent class by using the `super` method. Weâ€™ll use this pattern to customize how the sources are defined but default to the original logic for deciding the model asset keys. Copy and paste the code below to complete the `get_asset_key` function:
       
      ```python
      def get_asset_key(self, dbt_resource_props):
          resource_type = dbt_resource_props["resource_type"]
          name = dbt_resource_props["name"]
          if resource_type == "source":
              return AssetKey(f"taxi_{name}")
          else:
              return super().get_asset_key(dbt_resource_props)
      ```
      
      Youâ€™ve successfully written your first translator! 
      
      {% callout %}
      > ðŸ’¡ **Important!** dbt models and Dagster asset keys must be unique. If you're receiving a `DuplicateKeyError` , add some logging to verify that the logic in `get_asset_key` doesn't return two of the same key for different values!
      {% /callout %}

5. Now, update the definition that uses `@dbt_assets` to be configured with an instance of the `CustomizedDagsterDbtTranslator`. The `@dbt_assets` decorator has a `dagster_dbt_translator` argument that you can pass this instance into. **Donâ€™t forget to instantiate the class!** 

   Your code should look something like this:

   ```python
   @dbt_assets(
       manifest=dbt_project.manifest_path,
       dagster_dbt_translator=CustomizedDagsterDbtTranslator()
   )
   def dbt_analytics(context: AssetExecutionContext, dbt: DbtCliResource):
       yield from dbt.cli(["build"], context=context).stream()
   ```

At this point, your `dbt.py` file should match the following:

```python
from dagster import AssetExecutionContext, AssetKey
from dagster_dbt import DagsterDbtTranslator, DbtCliResource, dbt_assets

from ..project import dbt_project


class CustomizedDagsterDbtTranslator(DagsterDbtTranslator):
    def get_asset_key(self, dbt_resource_props):
        resource_type = dbt_resource_props["resource_type"]
        name = dbt_resource_props["name"]
        if resource_type == "source":
            return AssetKey(f"taxi_{name}")
        else:
            return super().get_asset_key(dbt_resource_props)

        
@dbt_assets(
    manifest=dbt_project.manifest_path, 
    dagster_dbt_translator=CustomizedDagsterDbtTranslator(),
)
def dbt_analytics(context: AssetExecutionContext, dbt: DbtCliResource):
    yield from dbt.cli(["build"], context=context).stream()
```
