# Capstone

Congrats on making it this far! In this section, you’ll apply what you’ve learned so far and continue to build on your Dagster and dbt project.

---

## Project data

The best way to apply what you’ve learned is to use your own organization’s data, but if this isn’t possible, you can use additional data from [NYC OpenData](https://opendata.cityofnewyork.us/) or [GitHub’s list of public APIs](https://github.com/public-apis/public-apis).

If using NYC OpenData, we recommend using the **311 Service Requests from 2010 to Present** dataset. The data is downloadable as a CSV and you’re welcome to view [details about it here](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Social-Services/311-Service-Requests-from-2010-to-Present/erm2-nwe9).

Whatever data you decide to use, choose something that sparks your interest!

You can also continue to use DuckDB if needed.
