#To turn the function into an asset in Dagster, youâ€™ll need to do two things:
import dagster as dg

'''
Note: dg check defs:
command in Dagster is used to validate the definitions of a Dagster project, ensuring they are correctly defined and can be loaded without errors.
It performs a static analysis of the project's definitions, including assets, jobs, resources, and sensors, to identify potential issues before runtime.

'''

@dg.asset decorator, you can easily turn any existing Python function into a Dagster asset.

#Add the @dg.asset decorator before the function


When an asset is materialized, Dagster runs the asset function and creates the asset by persisting the results in storage, such as in a data warehouse. When a materialization begins, it kicks off a run.

dg launch when you need to quickly test something out
dg dev as your Dagster project becomes more sophisticated.
